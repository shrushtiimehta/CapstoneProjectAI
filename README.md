# BlackBook Project - Strategy Optimization and Comparative Analysis in the Indian Market
Discovering the correct investment strategies in today’s fast-paced financial markets is like unearthing hidden treasures, particularly in India, where the financial markets are captivating an increasing number of people every day. Our approach takes on this difficulty head-on by automating stock and option trading techniques using cutting-edge technology. We meticulously trained two Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents, tailored for the stock and options markets. For stocks, our crafted strategies—mean reversion and exponential mean average 8 by 55—raked in impressive returns of 14.08% and 14.68%, respectively. With reinforcement learning, these strategies saw an astounding boost, yielding a staggering 51.15% and 33.52% return within just three years. On the options front, our novel trading strategies achieved remarkable returns of 102.82% and 77.14%, showcasing the power of our approach in this domain. By demonstrating the potential of advanced algorithms in enhancing trading efficiency, our work not only highlights the profitability of automated strategies but also offers valuable insights for navigating the Indian financial landscape with greater confidence and success.
